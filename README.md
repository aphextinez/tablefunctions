Given input table of numbers, apply function to table for desired output.

Tables of integers delimited by spaces, with rows delimited by newlines.
``` pattern indicates start and end of table. 

For example, going through running the program with a sample input: 
yael@Yaels-MacBook-Air target % java -jar tablefunctions-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
Enter row variation to apply: <checksum> | <evenlydivisible>
Enter "exit" to terminate
checksum
Enter the table input and press enter to execute: "```<input table>```"
Enter "exit" to terminate
```
